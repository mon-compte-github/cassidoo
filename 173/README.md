This week’s question:

**Given two non-negative integers n1 and n2 represented as strings, return the**
**product of n1 and n2, also represented as a string.** Neither input will start with 0,
and don’t just convert it to an integer and do the math that way.**

Example:

```
$ stringMultiply(“123”, “456”)
$ “56088”
```
